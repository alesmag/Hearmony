## About the Project

Hearmony is a group project developed by [Me](https://github.com/alesmag), [Anna Chiara Mameli](https://github.com/Pandanna), [Michele Cocco](https://github.com/Scoccc) and [Matteo Aresu](https://github.com/SaveAres) for the University of Cagliari. 
This project was intended to be a mobile app to interface with a social network where people would make "audio posts". 
Instead of a classic social media where one would need to constantly look at a screen, this would be almost exclusivly audible.
